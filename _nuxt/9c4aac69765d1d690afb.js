I've worked on everything from designing tube pre-amp's for my own hi-fi audio setup (ask me about it), to network switches, to communications modules for electronic life safety monitoring systems. I've been rocking shit in Linux as my default environment since 2004. While there was some inherent need to know a little programming to pick up Linux and run with it at that time, I knew very little. I started learning my way around the command line and never looked back. The majority of my work was on embedded systems using linux to host servers embedded into products. Eventually I started designing my own website. I was hosting it with some GoDaddy or AIG owned web hosting service and I needed to make a DNS update. This simple request got me to where I am today. The answer I got after waiting 15 minutes on hold was \"Yes, I'll handle that for you, but be aware DNS updates can take up to 24 hours to propagate.\" I shook my head in disbelief, having experience working on a team that developed a network switch, I understood a bit about how they worked and knew there was no way that reply could hold weight. I started learning how to configure a LAMP stack, migrated my domains to somewhere I had more control over DNS, and started learning different ways of configuring systems. I soon moved on to figuring out MEAN and MERN stacks. Eventually I learned about Docker, which led to compose, and eventually Kubernetes.

It all started at Colorado Hosting. I was instrumental in migrating over 250 VMs all running individual WordPress sites, all with their own embedded mysql databases, to a more distributed multi-region solution, while cutting the budget. At the end of a grueling year we managed to get every single site running in K8S with RDS databases, and reduced the department's overhead by 45% while providing enhanced reliability. While Colorado Hosting is no longer in existence (the owner sold it and retired), I am very proud of the team and the work we did."),o("br"),o("br"),e._v("\n      From there I've helped migrate two other companies to the cloud who were struggling with similar goals. At Influence Technologies I was again tasked with migrating their application from services on windows VMs to containerized services running in Kubernetes, along with taking ownership of the supporting services such as RavenDB and RabbitMQ. They also wanted to transition to more of a pipelines-first approach to deployments and new projects. Here I was able to help reduce time to deployment, increase productivity through automated workflows, and increase the overall performance of the platform through optimization by 3X!
